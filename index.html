        <p><em>Creeping Red Fiscue</em>is an easy, low-maintenance, fine-bladed grass that is found almost everywhere. With a name like<em><strong>red</strong>fescue</em>, it almost seems like a misnomer. The <em>"red"</em> comes from the dark, reddish-color at the base of the stalk on each blade. In reality, this species presents itself with a rich, medium-to-dark green color, making for beautiful landscapes! As for the <em><strong>"creeping"</strong></em>, that just describes how this tough plant grows and spreads throughout the soil. After earning a tough reputation of being able to thrive in all climates, including drought-like conditions, and being able to stand up to being trampled on, <em>creeping red fescue</em> is a favorite amongst landscapers for lawns, golf courses, fields, and playgrounds everywhere!

        <p>Named after what gives it it's charm, <em>Kentucky Bluegrass</em> offers a unique display of rich, emerald to blue-green colors. Despite the state of Kentucky laying claim to the nickname "Bluegrass State", this grass species did not originate from there. Native to Europe and northern Asia, this beautifully-colored species became popular in the U.S. as a pasture grass in states like Kentucky. Although this grass is more susceptible to drought-like conditions and may need some extra attention to maintain, the end result is worth the effort!
